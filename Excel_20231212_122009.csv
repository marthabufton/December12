Digital humanities—A discipline in its own right? An analysis of the role and position of digital humanities in the academic landscape,"Luhmann, Jan ;  Burghardt, Manuel","Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology, 2022, Vol.73 (2), p.148-171",,,,,"Although digital humanities (DH) has received a lot of attention in recent years, its status as “a discipline in its own right” (Schreibman et al., A companion to digital humanities (pp. xxiii–xxvii). Blackwell; 2004) and its position in the overall academic landscape are still being negotiated. While there are countless essays and opinion pieces that debate the status of DH, little research has been dedicated to exploring the field in a systematic and empirical way (Poole, Journal of Documentation; 2017:73). This study aims to contribute to the existing research gap by comparing articles published over the past three decades in three established English‐language DH journals (Computers and the Humanities, Literary and Linguistic Computing, Digital Humanities Quarterly) with research articles from journals in 15 other academic disciplines (corpus size: 34,041 articles; 299 million tokens). As a method of analysis, we use latent Dirichlet allocation topic modeling, combined with recent approaches that aggregate topic models by means of hierarchical agglomerative clustering. Our findings indicate that DH is simultaneously a discipline in its own right and a highly interdisciplinary field, with many connecting factors to neighboring disciplines—first and foremost, computational linguistics, and information science. Detailed descriptive analyses shed some light on the diachronic development of DH and also highlight topics that are characteristic for DH.",,,,ISSN: 2330-1635; EISSN: 2330-1643; DOI: 10.1002/asi.24533,,,"Hoboken, USA: John Wiley & Sons, Inc",,,,,,,Wiley Online Library; EBSCOhost Business Source Complete,,,,,,,,https://ocul-crl.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01OCUL_CRL/17erkeh/cdi_crossref_primary_10_1002_asi_24533

Building on the work of an iSchools organization committee charged with exploring digital humanities curricula, we present findings from a series of related studies exploring aspects of DH teaching, education, and research in iSchools, often in collaboration with other units and disciplines. Through a survey of iSchool programs and an online DH course registry, we investigate the various education models for DH training found in iSchools, followed by a detailed look at DH courses and curricula, explored through analysis of course syllabi and course descriptions. We take a brief look at collaborative disciplines with which iSchools cooperate on DH research projects or in offering DH education. Next, we explore DH careers through an analysis of relevant job advertisements. Finally, we offer some observations about the management and administrative challenges and opportunities related to offering a new iSchool DH program.

Communicating Uncertainty in Digital Humanities Visualization Research,"Panagiotidou, Georgia ;  Lamqaddam, Houda ;  Poblome, Jeroen ;  Brosens, Koenraad ;  Verbert, Katrien ;  Vande Moere, Andrew","IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics, 2023, Vol.29 (1), p.635-11",,,,,"Due to their historical nature, humanistic data encompass multiple sources of uncertainty. While humanists are accustomed to handling such uncertainty with their established methods, they are cautious of visualizations that appear overly objective and fail to communicate this uncertainty. To design more trustworthy visualizations for humanistic research, therefore, a deeper understanding of its relation to uncertainty is needed. We systematically reviewed 126 publications from digital humanities literature that use visualization as part of their research process, and examined how uncertainty was handled and represented in their visualizations. Crossing these dimensions with the visualization type and use, we identified that uncertainty originated from multiple steps in the research process from the source artifacts to their datafication. We also noted how besides known uncertainty coping strategies, such as excluding data and evaluating its effects, humanists also embraced uncertainty as a separate dimension important to retain. By mapping how the visualizations encoded uncertainty, we identified four approaches that varied in terms of explicitness and customization. This work contributes with two empirical taxonomies of uncertainty and it's corresponding coping strategies, as well as with the foundation of a research agenda for uncertainty visualization in the digital humanities. Our findings further the synergy among humanists and visualization researchers, and ultimately contribute to the development of more trustworthy, uncertainty-aware visualizations.",,,,ISSN: 1077-2626; ISSN: 2160-9306; ISSN: 1941-0506; EISSN: 1941-0506; DOI: 10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209436; PMID: 36166561,,,United States: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers,,,,,,,Scholars Portal Journals: IEEE; PubMed; IEEE Electronic Library (IEL),,,,,,,,https://ocul-crl.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01OCUL_CRL/17erkeh/cdi_unpaywall_primary_10_1109_tvcg_2022_3209436
Distribution features and intellectual structures of digital humanities: A bibliometric analysis,"Wang, Qing","Journal of documentation, 2018, Vol.74 (1), p.223-246",,Author productivity ;  Bibliometrics ;  Citation indexes ;  Cocitation ;  Cultural factors ;  Cultural resources ;  Design parameters ;  Digital humanities ;  Documents ;  Interdisciplinary aspects ;  Literature reviews ;  Scientometrics ;  Visualization,,,"Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to conduct a retrospective bibliometric analysis of documents about digital humanities, an emerging but interdisciplinary movement. It examines the distribution of research outputs and languages, identifies the active journals and institutions, dissects the network of categories and cited references, and interprets the hot research topics.
Design/methodology/approach
The source data are derived from the Web of Science (WoS) core collection. To reveal the holistic landscape of this field, VOSviewer and CiteSpace as popular visualization tools are employed to process the bibliographic data including author, category, reference, and keyword. Furthermore, the parameter design of the visualization tools follows the general procedures and methods for bibliometric analysis.
Findings
There is an obviously rapid growth in digital humanities research. English is still the leading academic language in this field. The most influential authors all come from or have scientific relationships with Europe and North America, and two leading countries of which are the UK and USA. Digital humanities is the result of a dynamic dialogue between humanistic exploration and digital means. This research field is closely associated with history, literary and cultural heritage, and information and library science.
Research limitations/implications
This analysis relies on the metadata information extracted from the WoS database; however, some valuable literatures in the field of digital humanities may not be retrieved from the database owing to the inherent challenge of topic search. This study is also restricted by the scope of publications, the limitation regarding the source of data is that WoS database may have underrepresented publications in this domain.
Originality/value
The output of this paper could be a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners interesting in the knowledge domain of digital humanities. Moreover, the conclusions of this retrospective analysis can be deemed as the comparable foundation for future study.",,,,ISSN: 0022-0418; EISSN: 1758-7379; DOI: 10.1108/JD-05-2017-0076,,,Bradford: Emerald Group Publishing Limited,,,,,,,"Library & Information Science Abstracts (LISA); Computer Science Database; Scholars Portal Journals: Emerald Management 150 Collection; Emerald Management 120; Advanced Technologies & Aerospace Collection; Art, Design & Architecture Collection; Arts & Humanities Database; Scholars Portal Journals: Emerald Management Collection; Scholars Portal Journals: Emerald",,,,,,,,https://ocul-crl.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01OCUL_CRL/17erkeh/cdi_proquest_journals_1983632384

Explaining digital humanities by aligning images and textual descriptions,"Cornia, Marcella ;  Stefanini, Matteo ;  Baraldi, Lorenzo ;  Corsini, Massimiliano ;  Cucchiara, Rita","Pattern recognition letters, 2020, Vol.129, p.166-172",,Algorithms ;  Computer vision ;  Cultural heritage ;  Datasets ;  Descriptions ;  Digital humanities ;  Digital imaging ;  Domains ;  Embedding ;  Human performance ;  Language ;  Natural language processing ;  Replication ;  Semantics ;  Semi-supervised learning ;  Sentences ;  Training ;  Visual-semantic retrieval,,,"•We propose semi-supervised visual-semantic models for the Digital Humanities domain.•Our approaches can align artistic images and text without paired supervision.•We transfer the knowledge learned on ordinary dataset to the artistic domain.•Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our distribution alignment strategy.
Replicating the human ability to connect Vision and Language has recently been gaining a lot of attention in the Computer Vision and the Natural Language Processing communities. This research effort has resulted in algorithms that can retrieve images from textual descriptions and vice versa, when realistic images and sentences with simple semantics are employed and when paired training data is provided. In this paper, we go beyond these limitations and tackle the design of visual-semantic algorithms in the domain of the Digital Humanities. This setting not only advertises more complex visual and semantic structures but also features a significant lack of training data which makes the use of fully-supervised approaches infeasible. With this aim, we propose a joint visual-semantic embedding that can automatically align illustrations and textual elements without paired supervision. This is achieved by transferring the knowledge learned on ordinary visual-semantic datasets to the artistic domain. Experiments, performed on two datasets specifically designed for this domain, validate the proposed strategies and quantify the domain shift between natural images and artworks.",,,,ISSN: 0167-8655; EISSN: 1872-7344; DOI: 10.1016/j.patrec.2019.11.018,,,Amsterdam: Elsevier B.V,,,,,,,Scholars Portal Journals: Elsevier Backfile: Decision Sciences; Scholars Portal Journals: Elsevier Backfile: Computer Science; ScienceDirect Journals; Scholars Portal Journals: Elsevier,,,,,,,,https://ocul-crl.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01OCUL_CRL/17erkeh/cdi_proquest_journals_2352369015

To define it precisely, two studies examined the American Psychological Association's system of controlled vocabulary—specifically, the 447 associated terms it presents—and used techniques from the Digital Humanities to identify 88 closely related concepts and six broad conceptual clusters. The resulting analyses show how similar ideas are interrelated: self-control, self-management, self-observation, learning, social behavior, and the personality constructs related to self-monitoring. A full-color network map locates these concepts and clusters relative to each other.
